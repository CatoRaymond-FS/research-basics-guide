      <h2>1. Getting Started with Research</h2>
      <p><strong>Research</strong> is all about asking questions and finding answers through facts, data, and thoughtful analysis. Whether you’re writing a paper or working on a development project, these basics will help guide your process.</p>

      <h3>What Is Research?</h3>
      <p>Research is the process of gathering information to answer a question or solve a problem. It involves investigating sources like academic papers, books, case studies, interviews, and trustworthy websites.</p>

      <h3>Types of Research</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Research:</strong> Data you collect yourself (surveys, interviews, experiments).</li>
        <li><strong>Secondary Research:</strong> Information gathered from existing sources (articles, books, academic journals).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Choosing a Topic</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Pick something you're curious about.</strong> If you're interested, your research will feel more exciting.</li>
        <li><strong>Make sure there’s enough information available.</strong> Use Google Scholar, your school library, or databases like IEEE Xplore.</li>
        <li><strong>Narrow it down.</strong> Instead of “Artificial Intelligence,” try “How AI is used in medical diagnostics.”</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Ask the Right Questions</h3>
      <p>Start your research by forming a good question. Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>“What are the environmental effects of electric vehicles?”</li>
        <li>“How does machine learning improve cancer detection rates?”</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Set a Goal</h3>
      <p>Decide what you want your research to do: inform, argue, compare, solve a problem, or analyze a topic. This will help you stay focused.</p>

  <h2>3. Research Methodology</h2>
  <p>Research methodology is the plan you follow to collect, analyze, and interpret information. A good methodology helps make your work credible, repeatable, and useful to others.</p>

  <h3>Common Research Types</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Uses numbers and data (surveys, experiments, statistics).</li>
    <li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> Focuses on understanding experiences or meanings (interviews, observations, case studies).</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed Methods:</strong> Combines both qualitative and quantitative research approaches.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Steps in the Research Process</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Define the Problem:</strong> Clearly state what you’re trying to understand or solve.</li>
    <li><strong>Review Literature:</strong> Find and analyze existing research related to your topic.</li>
    <li><strong>Formulate a Hypothesis:</strong> Make an educated guess based on what you’ve learned.</li>
    <li><strong>Choose a Method:</strong> Decide how you’ll gather and analyze data.</li>
    <li><strong>Collect Data:</strong> Carry out surveys, experiments, or interviews.</li>
    <li><strong>Analyze Results:</strong> Use graphs, charts, or tools like Python, R, or Excel to understand your findings.</li>
    <li><strong>Draw Conclusions:</strong> Explain what your results mean and how they relate to your hypothesis.</li>
    <li><strong>Document & Share:</strong> Write up your findings, properly cite sources, and present them clearly.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Tips for Writing Your Methodology Section</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Be clear and detailed—someone else should be able to repeat your process.</li>
    <li>Explain why you chose specific tools or methods.</li>
    <li>Include any challenges or limitations you faced during research.</li>
  </ul>

<section id="ieee-format">
  <h2>4. IEEE Formatting & Guidelines</h2>
  <p>The IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) format is commonly used in engineering, computer science, and other technical fields. It emphasizes clarity, citations, and professionalism.</p>

  <h3>Basic Structure of an IEEE Paper</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Title Page:</strong> Includes paper title, author(s), and affiliations.</li>
    <li><strong>Abstract:</strong> A brief summary (150–250 words) of your research, findings, and significance.</li>
    <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> 3–5 keywords that describe your research focus.</li>
    <li><strong>Introduction:</strong> Explains the research problem, context, and objectives.</li>
    <li><strong>Methodology:</strong> Details your approach, tools, and research design.</li>
    <li><strong>Results:</strong> Presents data, observations, and findings.</li>
    <li><strong>Discussion:</strong> Analyzes and interprets the results, and connects them to your hypothesis or problem.</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Summarizes your work and suggests future directions.</li>
    <li><strong>References:</strong> Lists all sources cited using IEEE citation style.</li>
  </ol>

  <h3>IEEE In-Text Citations</h3>
  <p>Use numbered citations in brackets that correspond to the reference list. Example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    According to the study in [3], neural networks have improved image classification tasks.
  </blockquote>

  <h3>IEEE Reference Format</h3>
  <p>References are listed in the order they appear in your paper. Here's an example:</p>
  <blockquote>
    [1] J. Smith and R. Brown, "Understanding AI," <i>IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks</i>, vol. 12, no. 4, pp. 123-130, Apr. 2020.
  </blockquote>

  <h2>6. Methodology & Research Approach</h2>
  <p>Understanding how to approach research methodically is crucial for producing strong, credible results. This section covers common strategies and tips for structuring your research process.</p>

  <h3>Define the Problem</h3>
  <p>Start by identifying what you're trying to solve or discover. A clear research question or hypothesis provides direction and purpose.</p>

  <h3>Do a Literature Review</h3>
  <p>Search for existing research related to your topic. Take notes, identify gaps, and build a foundation for your work.</p>

  <h3>Choose a Method</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Quantitative:</strong> Focuses on numbers and statistics (surveys, experiments, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Qualitative:</strong> Focuses on observations and themes (interviews, case studies, etc.).</li>
    <li><strong>Mixed Methods:</strong> Combines both to provide a richer picture.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Collect & Analyze Data</h3>
  <p>Gather data carefully, keeping everything organized. Use tools like Excel, R, or Python for analysis. Be transparent about how your conclusions were reached.</p>

  <h3>Write It Up</h3>
